These are small challenges I've done, in a program I took part, where we had to develop 7 projects with HTML, CSS and JS in 10 days.
They are all beginner's level.

They are:
Aluraflix - It makes a web page listing the poster of your favorite movies.
Calculator - It simulates a calculator interface on the web.
Currency converter - It converts GPB to ZAR.
Mentalist - It chooses a random number and you have to guess which was it.
Supertrunfo - Simulates a card game against the computer.
Score sheet - Provides an interactive environment to count the scores of a game.
Certificard - A certificate including links for all those projects.
